// Let there be N workers and N jobs. Any worker can be assigned to perform any job,
//  incurring some cost that may vary depending on the work-job assignment. 
//  It is required to perform all jobs by assigning exactly one worker to each job 
//  and exactly one job to each agent in such a way that the total cost of the assignment is minimized.
